02/28/2024 18:37:02 : [INFO] gemma: Sure, here is a poem about Machine Learning and low-tier labors:

Machines, they weave a web so vast,
A tapestry of algorithms cast.
They sift and sort, they learn from data's might,
Unleashing the power of the digital light.

Low-tier labors, a symphony,
A chorus of code, a symphony.
They toil away, unfettered and free,
Building the future, just for me.

From mundane tasks to the complex and grand,
They automate, a seamless hand.
They streamline processes, make decisions fast,
Easing burdens, leaving humans in the past.

So here's to the machines, both old and new,
A marvel of engineering, it's true.
They shape our world, both near and far,
A symphony of progress, beyond compare.
